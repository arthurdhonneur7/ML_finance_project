# ML_finance_project

Raw data for the project should be placed in a folder named `data_raw`. A separate folder named `data_clean` should be created to store the processed data. Before running any models, it is essential to execute the `data_processing.ipynb` notebook, which handles the necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This will generate the processed datasets required by the modeling scripts. Once the preprocessing is complete, you can access and run the models located in the `workspaces` folder.
